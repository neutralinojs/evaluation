# Why Neutralinojs is better for lightweight apps? â€” proof

[Neutralinojs](https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs) framework was evaluated in comparison with Electron and NW.js considering disk consumption, memory consumption, easiness of development workflow and portability.

**Please notice that the following comparison data may not match with the latest releases of Neutralinojs, NW.js, and Electron. This benchmark was done in 2018.**

### Sample applications

Simple `Hello World` type application is used in each framework on Linux and Windows for the evaluation.

#### OS details

- Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS

```


### Neutralinojs


#### Linux

```
Portable SDK size                 5.8 MB
Portable SDK size (zipped)        1.1 MB
File count                        11
```
#### Windows

```
Portable SDK size                 5.53 MB
Portable SDK size (zipped)        1.01 MB
File count                        11
```
SDK and application bundle are similar things in Neutralino. We will be introducing an application builder CLI soon!. Alternatively project can be zipped as the application bundle. Special case is that a single application bundle will work on both platforms unlike other frameworks do.

See [proof](https://github.com/neutralinojs/evaluation/tree/master/files/disk/proof) directory for sample sources and binary releases.

## 2. Memory consumption

### NW.js

```
Linux                           ~ 40 - 42 MB
Windows                         ~ 40 - 45 MB
```

### Electron

```
Linux                           ~ 62 - 65 MB
Windows                         ~ 45 - 50 MB
```

### Neutralinojs

```
Linux                           ~ 8 - 9 MB
Windows                         ~ 6 - 7 MB  
```

## 3. Easiness of Development Workflow

*Note - [neu-cli](https://neutralino.js.org/docs/#/tools/cli) offers an automated development workflow*

### Neutralino Debugging

Neutralino app is served via a socket. Therefore debugging can be done using a web browser.

## 4. Performance

Neutralino's performance basically depends on the performance of C++ server implementation. Here is the result for `Neutralino.os.runCommand` for `ls` command for 100 samples. It took average 6 miliseconds to respond `ls` bash command.   

| Label        | # Samples | Average | Median | 90% Line | 95% Line | 99% Line | Min | Max | Error % | Throughput | Received KB/sec | Sent KB/sec | 
|--------------|-----------|---------|--------|----------|----------|----------|-----|-----|---------|------------|-----------------|-------------| 
| HTTP Request | 100       | 6       | 6      | 8        | 9        | 11       | 4   | 13  | 0.000%  | 87.87346   | 12.36           | 22.05       | 
| TOTAL        | 100       | 6       | 6      | 8        | 9        | 11       | 4   | 13  | 0.000%  | 87.87346   | 12.36           | 22.05       | 

Result was captured by [Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) using [this](https://github.com/neutralinojs/evaluation/blob/master/files/testing/REST/api_test.jmx) test plan. See more details about this report [here](http://www.testingjournals.com/understand-summary-report-jmeter/). 

## 5. Conclusion

According to the results of this expertiment Neutralino can be used as a lightweight alternative for Electron and NW.js. Furthermore another experiment needs to be done by using somewhat large cross platform application such as [draw.io](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio). There are some drawbacks such as Windows edition is based on IE etc.
